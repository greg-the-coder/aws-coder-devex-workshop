## Welcome
Welcome to improving Developer Experience with AWS and Coder, your gateway to understanding and leveraging the Coder platform. This workshop is designed to equip you with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to create, manage, and optimize a wide range of development environments. Whether you're a developer, platform engineer, or a partner embarking on your first experience with Coder, this workshop sets the stage for your success.

Imagine a development environment that is seamless, consistent, and hassle-free, without the frustrations of mismatched dependencies or local machine configurations. Coder makes this possible by centralizing development in secure, self-hosted workspaces, ensuring that every developer has access to a standardized, fully equipped environment tailored to their needs. Instead of spending time troubleshooting setup issues, you can focus entirely on coding, knowing that your workspace is always ready, secure, and optimized for performance.
